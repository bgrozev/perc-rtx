        This document discusses the use of the RTX format for RTP packet
        retransmission in the context of a PERC (Privacy Enhanced RTP
        Conferenceing) conference.

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>
        In multi-endpoint RTP conferences it is desired for middleboxes (e.g.
        Selecting Forwarding Units (SFUs), or in the case of PERC Media
        Distributors (MDs)) to terminate RTP packet retransmission, because
        this can reduce the retransmission delay and the unnecessary
        retransmission of packets.  In the context of PERC, if RTX is handled
        as a regular media stream, then an MD can not terminate packet
        retransmission.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
        in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Terminating RTX'>
      <t>
        The RTX format (RFC 4588) uses the first two bytes of the RTP payload
        (the Original Sequence Number field (OSN)) to transport the RTP
        sequence number of the retransmitted packet.
      </t>
      <t>
        If the procedure used for regular media streams is also used for RTX,
        the MD does not have access to the OSN field, because it is E2E
        encrypted as part of the RTP payload, and this prevents it from
        terminating retransmissions.
      </t>
      <t>
        In the context of PERC, RTX should be performed only HBH. That is, the
        payload of the RTX packet must be encrypted with the HBH context, but
        not with the E2E context.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='RTP Padding'>
      <t>
        RFC3550 allows an RTP packet to contain only padding, and no payload.
        The number of padding bytes is contained in the last byte of the
        payload, and it is encrypted by SRTP.
      </t>
      <t>
        In the context of PERC, an MD does not have access to the padding
        length field of an RTX packet, and therefore it can not determine
        whether the packet contains non-padding payload or not.
      </t>
      <t>
        RTX packets with padding only are currently used by some bandwidth
        estimation algorithms in order to "ramp-up". Since an MD might want
        to terminate bandwidth estimation, there is a need for a new way for
        the MD to recognize packets with no payload (e.g padding-only).
      </t>
      <t>
        This can be accomplished by using a single "padding-only" bit in
        an RTP header extension. We propose to transport this bit as part
        of the framemarking header extension, because it is already used
        by PERC and adding a separate extension will consume one of a 
        limited set of available extension IDs. We propose to use the
        first bit of the unused bits in the format for non-scalable streams,
        which is marked as the P bit in the diagram below.
